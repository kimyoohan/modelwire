rem ModelWire weekly refresh. Registered in Task Scheduler as "ModelWire Weekly Refresh" (Mon 10:17).
rem FIX 2026-07-07: the previous version hardcoded a non-ASCII (Korean) path in `cd /d`. Under the
rem Task Scheduler codepage that cd FAILED silently, so every step ran in C:\Windows\System32 (the
rem wrong directory): Codex refused ("not a git repo") and did nothing, and headless Claude could not
rem find its order files and WANDERED into an unrelated project. Root-cause fix below:
rem   1) cd via the script's own location (%~dp0) - Windows resolves it correctly regardless of codepage.
rem   2) this file is now 100%% ASCII (no Korean anywhere) so cmd.exe cannot mis-decode it.
rem   3) hard guards: if cd fails or the order file is missing, write an ALERT and abort - never improvise.
cd /d "%~dp0.." || (echo CD FAILED > "%~dp0ALERT-cd-failed.txt" & exit /b 1)
echo Working dir: %CD%
if not exist "UPDATE_ORDER.md" (echo UPDATE_ORDER.md not found in %CD% - wrong dir, aborting > "ops\ALERT-refresh-wrongdir.txt" & exit /b 1)
